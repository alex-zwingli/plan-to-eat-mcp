# plan-to-eat MCP

This skill teaches you to use the `plan-to-eat` MCP server effectively. The server gives you full read/write access to a Plan to Eat account: recipe book, weekly planner, shopping list.

## Setup check

If the user references Plan to Eat but no `plan-to-eat__*` tools are available, the MCP server isn't wired into this session.

- If you have a shell and the `plan-to-eat` CLI is installed, use the **`plan-to-eat-cli`** skill instead — same 36 capabilities, driven through subcommands.
- Otherwise the server isn't installed yet. Offer the setup below. Don't try to scrape the web app instead.

### If it isn't installed

The server is published to npm as [`plan-to-eat-mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plan-to-eat-mcp) and needs Node 18+. **Show these commands to the user rather than running them yourself** — they change the host's configuration, and the credentials must come from the user's own shell, not from you.

```bash
# Claude Code:
claude mcp add plan-to-eat -- npx -y plan-to-eat-mcp

# Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Zed — the same stdio block:
#   "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "plan-to-eat-mcp"]
```

No clone or build step. To pin a version, use `plan-to-eat-mcp@<version>`; to avoid the per-launch npx resolve, `npm i -g plan-to-eat-mcp` and use the `plan-to-eat-mcp` bin as the command with no args.

Claude Code users who want the skills *and* the server together can instead install the plugin from a clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alex-zwingli/plan-to-eat-mcp.git
cd plan-to-eat-mcp && npm install && npm run build
claude plugin marketplace add "$(pwd)"
claude plugin install plan-to-eat@plan-to-eat
```

**Credentials** come from two environment variables the host passes through:

| Var | Required | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `PLAN_TO_EAT_USERNAME` | yes | — |
| `PLAN_TO_EAT_PASSWORD` | yes | — |
| `PLAN_TO_EAT_SESSION_FILE` | no | `~/.plan-to-eat-session.json` |

Ask the user to export them in their shell profile. **Never ask them to paste a password into the conversation, and never put credentials in a command you run.** After installing, the host has to be restarted before the tools appear.

Prefer these MCP tools when they're available: no subprocess per call, and structured results without a JSON round-trip.
## Core concepts

**Recipe** — identified by numeric `id`. Fetch the catalog with `list_recipes` (returns ~500 entries with summaries); drill into one with `get_recipe` for directions/comments/full ingredient list. **Recipe IDs are not guessable** — always look them up before referencing.

**Planner event** — a single entry on the calendar. Shape:
```
{ id, date, section, kind, recipe_id?, description?, servings, ... }
```
- `kind` is `recipe`, `note`, or `ingredient`
- `section` is `breakfast`, `lunch`, `dinner`, or `snacks`
- `date` is `YYYY-MM-DD`
- note and ingredient text reads back under `description`; `title` is `null` for notes

**Frozen recipe** — a freezer entry tracking N portions of a previously cooked recipe. Shape: `{ id, recipe_id, count, servings, frozen_on }`. `count` is portions remaining; `servings` is per-portion size. The API soft-deletes by zeroing `count` rather than removing the row.

**Shopping list line** — one row of the list. It has no scalar id: Plan to Eat merges duplicate ingredients (the garlic three planned recipes each need) into one line carrying every underlying row id in an `item_ids` array. That array is the handle for `update_shopping_list_items` and `remove_shopping_list_items` — pass all of it. Each line also names the store it's assigned to (`store_title`, plus `store_id` which is `null` for the account's default store) and the aisle it's filed under (`grocery_category_title`). `recipe_ids` tells you which planned recipes pulled it in — an empty one was added by hand.

**A "week"** is whatever 7-day window the user means. Use `get_planner_week` with a `start_date`; `end_date` defaults to `start_date + 6 days`. If the user says "this week" without specifying a start day, ask or pick today.

## Common workflows

### "What's on the meal plan this week?"
```
get_planner_week({ start_date: "2026-05-04" })
```
Recipe events come pre-enriched with `recipe_title` — you don't need to join against `list_recipes`. Group the response by `date` then `section` for a readable answer.

### "Plan [recipe] for Wednesday dinner"
1. `list_recipes` → filter client-side to find the recipe id by title (case-insensitive match)
2. `add_planner_recipe({ recipe_id, date, section: "dinner" })`
3. If the user mentioned servings: follow up with `set_planner_servings({ event_id, servings })` using the id returned from step 2

### "Add a prep note: defrost chicken Monday morning"
```
add_planner_note({ date: "2026-05-04", section: "breakfast", title: "Defrost chicken" })
```

### "Add 2 lbs ground beef to Wednesday dinner"
```
add_planner_ingredient({ date: "2026-05-06", section: "dinner", title: "2 lbs ground beef" })
```
Use this for grocery-style additions tied to a meal slot. For the actual shopping list, see the shopping list workflows below.

### "Move Tuesday dinner to Wednesday"
1. `get_planner_week` to find the event id
2. `move_planner_event({ event_id, date: "<Wed>", section: "dinner" })`

### "Change [meal] from 2 servings to 4"
1. `get_planner_week` → find event id (must be a recipe event)
2. `set_planner_servings({ event_id, servings: 4 })`

### "Edit that note to say X"
```
update_planner_entry_text({ id, description: "X" })
```
**Note**: this tool uses `description` on the wire, even though `add_planner_note` uses `title` on create. Rails inconsistency — just remember it.

### "Is [recipe] already on the plan this week?"
1. `list_recipes` → resolve recipe id
2. `find_planned_dates({ recipe_id, start_date, end_date })`

### "Duplicate Tuesday's dinner to Friday"
```
duplicate_planner_event({ id, plan_leftover: false })
// returns a copy on the same date — then move it
move_planner_event({ event_id: <new id>, date: "<Fri>", section: "dinner" })
```
Set `plan_leftover: true` if the user explicitly says "as a leftover".

### "Plan Tuesday's lasagna as leftovers on Thursday"
Use the leftover convenience tool — it does the duplicate + move in one call:
```
add_leftover_meal({ source_event_id: <Tuesday lasagna event id>, date: "<Thu>", section: "dinner" })
```
Omit `date`/`section` to leave the leftover on the same day/slot as the source.

### "Reorder breakfast: pancakes first, then bacon"
```
reorder_planner_events({ event_ids: [<pancakes id>, <bacon id>] })
```
All ids should be in the same date+section.

### "Freeze 3 portions of last night's chili"
1. Find the planner event id for the chili (`get_planner_week`).
2. `freeze_recipe_portions({ recipe_id, event_id, count: 3, servings: 1.0 })` — `event_id` is the planner event the portions came from.
3. Confirm with `list_frozen_recipes` to surface the new entry id.

### "What's in the freezer?"
```
list_frozen_recipes()  // active only (count > 0)
list_frozen_recipes({ include_consumed: true })  // history too
```
Recipe titles aren't pre-joined — call `get_recipe` per `recipe_id` if the user wants names.

### "We ate the freezer chili"
```
delete_frozen_recipe({ id: <frozen entry id> })
```
This is a soft-delete: API sets `count` to 0; the entry stays in history.

### "Remove that from the plan"
```
delete_planner_event({ id })
```

### "What's on the shopping list?"
```
get_shopping_list()
```
Report it grouped by `store_title` — that's how the user shops. Within a store, `grocery_category_title` is the aisle order. Mention notes (`extra_notes`) when there are any.

### "Add sliced almonds and a jar of tahini to the list"
```
add_shopping_list_items({ items: [
  { title: "Sliced almonds" },
  { title: "Tahini", amount: "1", unit: "jar" },
] })
```
Don't set `category_id` or `store_id` unless the user asked for a specific store or aisle: left off, Plan to Eat guesses the aisle and reuses the store last chosen for that item, which is nearly always what the user wants. To honor "get it at Trader Joe's", look the id up with `list_stores` first.

### "Move the almonds to Costco" / "put that in the Spices aisle"
1. `get_shopping_list` → the line's `item_ids`
2. `list_stores` or `list_grocery_categories` → the id
3. `update_shopping_list_items({ item_ids, store_id })`

Re-filing takes as many lines as you pass, so batch a "move all of these to Costco" into one call.

### "Make it two jars, and call it hot paprika"
```
update_shopping_list_items({ item_ids, title: "Hot paprika", amount: "2" })
```
One line at a time — ids spanning two lines are refused. Only pass the fields that change; the rest are preserved. The call returns the line as it now stands, so take fresh `item_ids` from the result if you're going to act on it again.

### "Take the bananas off the list"
```
remove_shopping_list_items({ item_ids })
```
`restore_shopping_list_items({ item_ids })` undoes it — but nothing can list removed lines, so keep the ids in your reply if the user might want them back.

## Gotchas

- **`section` can come back as `supper`** — Plan to Eat normalizes to the user's per-account preference. Always send `dinner` on input; recognize `supper` as the same thing on read.
- **Create/duplicate may return `null`** — under the hood the API returns empty bodies, so the MCP recovers the new event by diffing `list_planner_events` before/after. If a concurrent change happens, the diff can miss. Re-list to find the new event.
- **Don't blindly accept the user's date** — Plan to Eat dates are `YYYY-MM-DD`. If the user says "Tuesday", convert to a real date relative to today.
- **Recipe events need a real `recipe_id`** — `add_planner_recipe` will not create a new recipe. To plan something not in the book, either `create_recipe` first, or use `add_planner_note` / `add_planner_ingredient` for freeform text.
- **Don't use `find_planned_dates` to look up recipes by title** — it's keyed on `recipe_id`. For "what recipes do I have", use `list_recipes`.
- **A shopping list line is `item_ids`, plural** — one line can hold several row ids. Naming any of them affects the whole line, so you don't have to be precise; but don't assume every id you sent still exists afterwards. A text edit consolidates a merged line into one row (keeping the combined quantity), so re-read `item_ids` from the response.
- **`store_id: null` isn't "no store"** — it's the account's default store, and `store_title` names it. Read the title, not the id.
- **Removing a shopping list item is invisible afterwards** — the API won't list removed lines, so restoring one needs ids you kept from before.
